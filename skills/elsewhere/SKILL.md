# Working an Elsewhere desktop

Elsewhere is a Wayland compositor whose screen is a browser tab. It is also the window manager,
so it can tell you what is on the screen and act on it. You talk to it over HTTP with a bearer token
(retrieve it on the server with `elsewhere token`), or through its MCP tools, which are the same
operations under the same names. `reference.md` next to this file lists every route, tool and field.

```sh
T=...                                   # the token; usually in $ELSEWHERE_TOKEN or ~/.config/elsewhere/token
H="Authorization: Bearer $T"
curl -s -H "$H" https://host:8443/api/windows | jq
```

If the deployment uses a URL prefix, prepend it to every HTTP route in this skill and the reference.
For example, `/elsewhere/alice/api/windows` and `/elsewhere/alice/mcp` address that instance.

## The loop that works

1. **Look at the window list first** (`GET /api/windows`, tool `windows`). Each window has an `id`, a
   `title`, an `app_id`, `focused`, `minimized`, and its geometry `x y w h` in logical pixels. Ids are
   stable for the window's life. Menus and tooltips are not windows; they show up as `popups` on the
   window that owns them.
2. **Read the window's elements** (`GET /api/windows/{id}/elements`, tool `elements`) instead of
   guessing from pixels. You get buttons, links, text fields, menu items, tabs, checkboxes and so on,
   each with `role`, `name` and a rectangle `x y w h` **relative to the window's own `x y`**. The
   answer's `level` tells you how much the application exposes: `full` is the normal case; `none`
   means the toolkit publishes nothing (terminals, games); `frame` means Chromium or Electron running
   without `--force-renderer-accessibility`. Below `full` the application's part of the list is empty
   (the compositor's title bar and buttons, when it draws them, are still there) and a snapshot is
   your only view of the content.
3. **Act on an element** with the input operations (`POST /api/input`, tools `click`, `type`, `key`,
   `scroll`, `move_pointer`). Pass the window id together with element-relative coordinates, for
   example the centre of the element's rectangle, and the server adds the window position for you.
   Without a window id the coordinates are output coordinates.
4. **Read the elements again** after acting; the tree reflects the new state (menus that opened,
   dialogs that appeared as new windows). Menus are placed at their popup, so their items have
   correct rectangles too.
5. **Take a snapshot when you need to see** (`GET /api/windows/{id}/snapshot.png`, tool `snapshot`;
   `/api/screenshot.png`, tool `screenshot`). Window snapshots are lossless PNGs of the window's own
   buffers, so they work for covered and minimized windows; `percentage=50` halves either kind; `width` or `height` requests image pixels.
   Omitted sizing returns native dimensions. Request a preview such as `percentage=25`
   when full detail is unnecessary. Supply only one sizing parameter. Prefer elements for finding things and snapshots for confirming.

## Input details

- `click` moves the pointer there first. `button` is `left` (default), `right` or `middle`; `count`
  2 double-clicks. For a drag use `button` (press), `move`, `button` (release).
- `text` types a string through the keyboard layout, including punctuation and capitals; `\n` is
  Return. Click into the field first so it has focus. For longer text, put it on the clipboard
  (`PUT /api/clipboard`, tool `clipboard_write`) and press `ctrl+v` in the field; `GET /api/clipboard`
  (tool `clipboard_read`) returns what an application last copied, text or a PNG (its Content-Type says
  which), and a PNG body with `Content-Type: image/png` on the PUT puts an image on the clipboard.
- Files require a control token and an explicit directory: `GET /api/files?path=@transfer` lists
  Downloads. Use `@home` or an absolute path for another directory. MCP `files` takes `path` and
  optional `hidden`, `sort`, `desc`, `offset`, and `limit`, returning the same paginated listing.
  `GET` and `PUT /api/files/{name}?path=…` download or upload an entry in that directory.
- `key` presses a chord and releases it: `ctrl+s`, `ctrl+shift+t`, `alt+F4`, `Return`, `Escape`,
  `Tab`, `Down`, `Prior` (Page Up), `F5`. Modifier names: `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `super`. Anything
  else is an X keysym name or a single character; `ctrl+T` is the same as `ctrl+t` (write `shift` when
  you mean it). A chord with a key the layout doesn't have does nothing.
- `scroll` takes wheel lines; positive `dy` scrolls down.
- Input goes to whatever is under the pointer or has keyboard focus, exactly as a user's would. Click a
  window (or `activate` it) before typing into it. A human viewer may be connected at the same time;
  you share one pointer and keyboard with them.

## Windows and programs

- `activate` raises and focuses a window (and restores it if minimized); `close`, `minimize`,
  `unminimize`, `maximize`, `unmaximize`, `fullscreen`, `unfullscreen` do what they say; `move` and
  `resize` work on floating windows. These requests are fire-and-forget: check the window list
  afterwards.
- A `click` that aims past the desktop's edge at an X11 window (one that hangs past the edge) answers
  "ok" with a warning: Xwayland pins such a click to the edge. Move or resize the window first, or make
  the desktop larger. Wayland windows take clicks anywhere.
- `applications` lists what is installed (the desktop's `.desktop` launchers) and `launch` starts one by
  its `id`; `spawn` runs any shell command as a client of this desktop (`sh -c`), with the display
  variables set. Programs take a moment to map their window; poll the window list. A program that is
  already running elsewhere may just open a new window in that instance.
- `updated_ms` on a window is the time of its last redraw to the second. If it stops changing, the
  application is idle.

## What the answers mean when they fail

| Status | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 400 | invalid screenshot sizing | supply one positive width, height or percentage within the documented limits |
| 401 | missing or wrong bearer token | check `Authorization: Bearer` |
| 403 | the token is the view-only one (`read-only token`) | it can list windows, read elements, take snapshots and read the clipboard, nothing else; ask for the control token |
| 404 | no such window | the window closed; list again |
| 429 | another snapshot is in flight | one at a time; retry after it returns |
| 500 | the snapshot render failed | retry after checking the error |
| 501 | the server runs without `--elements` | use snapshots instead |
| 503 | the compositor or the accessibility bus didn't answer | retry once; if the body says there is no D-Bus session, elements are not available on this server |
| 400, 415, 422 | the body wasn't JSON, lacked `Content-Type: application/json`, or had the wrong shape (plain-text message) | see `reference.md` for the shape |

MCP tools return the same failures as tool errors with the same text.

## Things that surprise people

- Coordinates from `elements` are relative to the window; the window's own `x y` are output
  coordinates. Pass the window id to the input operations and you never have to add them.
- A window with `decoration: 32` has a title bar drawn by the compositor above it. Its elements list
  ends with that bar (`title bar`) and its `Close`, `Maximize`/`Restore` and `Minimize` buttons at
  `y: -32`: click those like any element (negative `y` is fine), or use the `window_control` tool.
- Two windows of the same application look alike in the list; use `title` and `focused`.
- A dialog is a new window with its own id. A file chooser is often a separate window too.
- Chromium and Electron applications need `--force-renderer-accessibility` on their command line to
  expose their content; without it you get `level: frame`. Firefox and GTK and Qt applications work as
  started by `spawn`.
- The screen is whatever size the connected viewer is; with no viewer it is 1920×1080.

## Desktop broadcasts

Broadcast workers repeat the newest picture at the requested frame rate. Unique pictures remain
limited by desktop refresh, normally 30 Hz with software rendering and 60 Hz with GPU rendering.
Destination failures retry until stopped, with backoff up to 32 seconds. Coincident audio and
network errors retry; an audio failure without a destination failure ends that output.


`broadcast_capabilities` reports encoder availability and limits. `broadcast_start` takes complete
settings: `request_id`, `label`, `url`, `stream_key`, `width`, `height`, `fps`, `bitrate_kbps`,
`audio` (`desktop` or `silence`), and `cursor` (boolean). Use a fresh request ID for each intended run.
Retry the identical request with the same ID for ten minutes to recover an uncertain response;
changing its settings conflicts. A retry never restarts a retained stopped run.

`broadcast_list` and `broadcast_get` return runtime IDs and status, never destination credentials.
`broadcast_stop` takes an `id` and is idempotent while that record is retained. Start and stop require
a control token, including when a different browser controls the pointer. The viewer token can read
status only. `sending` means media transport is active, not that the service has made it public.

Broadcasts continue without browser viewers. Up to four independent H.264/AAC outputs can run.
Silent audio does not require the private audio service. Settings are not saved on the host;
browser presets belong to that browser and cannot be retrieved through MCP. Supply connection
settings yourself when using MCP. See the generated reference for the matching HTTP routes.
