# MCP, input and the skill documents

Coding agents drive the desktop through the same operations as the HTTP API, so an agent can find a
button by name, click it, type, and check the result without interpreting pixels. This document covers
the design; [protocol.md](protocol.md) has the wire shapes and `skills/elsewhere/reference.md` the
generated schemas.

With `--url-prefix`, external clients prepend the public prefix to `/mcp` and HTTP routes.
See [reverse proxy setup](reverse-proxy.md) for both path-forwarding modes.

## Decisions

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Protocol | MCP over Streamable HTTP at `/mcp` on the existing server, with the `rmcp` SDK. No second port or process; works remotely and from the container. Agents that only speak stdio use the standard `mcp-remote` bridge. |
| Auth | Bearer authentication shares the HTTP middleware. Each tool enforces its operation permissions and reports denied grants as tool errors. Revocation and expiry cancel the affected token’s requests and streams. No OAuth. |
| Shape of the tools | One tool per operation, each a few lines calling an `App` method. The generated [tool reference](../skills/elsewhere/reference.md#mcp-tools) lists every tool from the router. Arguments use the API's own types where they exist (`Button`, the control ops) so the vocabulary is shared. |
| Results | JSON as text content for lists and elements, `image/png` content for snapshots, `ok` for fire-and-forget actions, and `isError` results carrying the API's error text so the model can react. |
| Documentation | The manual is the server's `instructions` at `initialize` and both skill files are MCP resources, so a client gets the documentation with the connection. |
| Screenshots for models | `snapshot` and `screenshot` default to native dimensions. Supply one of `width`, `height`, or `percentage` for previews; [sizing limits](desktop-api.md#screenshot-sizing). |

## Input

The compositor could always move the pointer, click and press keys: that is how the viewer works. What
was missing was a way in other than the viewer's binary WebSocket. `InputMsg` in `elsewhere-core` is that way:
`move`, `click`, `button`, `scroll`, `key`, `text`, served as `POST /api/input` and as tools.

- The server only checks that a named window exists (for the `404`) and forwards the message as one
  `Command::Input`. The compositor resolves window-relative coordinates against the geometry it has at
  that moment and emits a click's motion and button events in one go, so neither a moving window nor a
  human's pointer motion arriving in between can redirect it. Coordinates are output logical pixels or,
  with a window id, relative to that window's geometry, the origin element rectangles use.
- Keys are resolved where the keymap is. `key_for` in `input.rs` scans the active layout for the
  keycode producing a keysym at levels 0 to 3 and `level_mods` adds Shift, AltGr or both for the level,
  the convention of four-level layouts, so `text` types any character the layout has (`@` on a German
  layout is AltGr+q) and `key` accepts every xkb keysym name plus friendly modifier names. A lone letter
  in a chord is lowercased first, so `ctrl+T` is Ctrl+T, not Ctrl+Shift+T.
- A chord aborts as a whole when a keysym has no key in the layout, rather than pressing the modifiers
  alone; a character `text` can't produce is skipped with a warning. Press and release go out back to
  back; GTK, Firefox and Chromium process them in order, so no pacing was needed.
- `tap` releases only the keys it pressed itself: the `key()` guard drops a press for a key a viewer is
  already holding, and that key stays held for the viewer afterwards.

## Skill documents

Two files, both compiled in with `include_str!` and served at `/skill/`:

- `SKILL.md`, written by hand for an agent: the loop (windows, elements, act, read again, snapshot to
  confirm), input details, what the status codes mean, and the things that surprise people.
- `reference.md`, generated: the route table, the JSON schemas of `WindowInfo`, `ControlMsg`,
  `InputMsg` and the elements page (from `schemars`, the same derive rmcp uses for tool arguments),
  and every MCP tool with its description and input schema (from the tool router). The
  `reference_is_current` test compares the checked-in file with what the code generates, so it is
  regenerated with `UPDATE_REFERENCE=1 cargo test -p elsewhere-server reference` (after `make web`, which
the embedded viewer needs) and cannot silently drift.

## Verification

- A scripted MCP handshake with curl against a test compositor: `initialize` (server info,
  capabilities, instructions), `tools/list` matching the generated tool reference, `resources/list`
  and `resources/read`, and `tools/call` for `windows`, `elements`, `click`, `type` (text appeared in the editor) and `snapshot`
  (a PNG of the window's size), plus a tool error for an unknown window and `401` without the token.
- The input route through curl: click into an editor, type text with punctuation and capitals, `Return`,
  `ctrl+a`; the snapshot showed the typed lines selected.
- Key resolution has a unit test on the `us` keymap (letters, Shift for capitals and `plus`, `ctrl`,
  `Return`, `F5`).
