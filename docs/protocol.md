# Protocol and HTTP API

The server speaks two things: a binary WebSocket protocol for the viewer page and a JSON/PNG HTTP API
for scripts. Both are guarded by two shared tokens from the data directory: `token`, the control token,
which may do everything, and `viewer-token`, which may only look (`elsewhere token --viewer` retrieves it): the video, the window list, elements, snapshots and the clipboard's text, but no input, window
actions, programs or clipboard writes.

Routes below are relative to the public URL prefix, if configured. For example, with
`--url-prefix /elsewhere/alice`, the viewer connects to `/elsewhere/alice/ws` and API clients use
`/elsewhere/alice/api/...`. See [reverse proxy setup](reverse-proxy.md) for forwarding modes.

## Authentication

- **Viewer page** (`/`, `/app.js`, `/app.css`): public. The token arrives once in the
  URL fragment (`/#token=…`, supplied by the user), is moved into
  `sessionStorage` and stripped from the address bar; a page with no token shows a dialog asking for one.
- **WebSocket** (`/ws`): the first message must be `AUTH` with a token. Until then the socket is
  nobody: nothing is processed. A wrong token, or five seconds of silence, closes it with code **4001**
  `unauthorized`. Which token it was decides the session's role (below).
- **Window streams** (`/ws/window/{id}`): authenticated like `/ws`; see below.
- **HTTP API** (`/api/...`): `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Nothing else is accepted, so the token
  never appears in a URL the server or a proxy logs. The viewer token gets `403` from the routes that act.
- `POST /api/token/rotate` (control token) replaces both tokens everywhere at once.

No cookies are used anywhere.

## WebSocket messages

Binary frames, little-endian, byte 0 is the type. Mirrored in `crates/elsewhere-server/src/protocol.rs` and
`web/src/viewer.js` (with the constants in `web/src/protocol.js`).

### Server → client

| Type | Name | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `0x01` | Config | JSON `{streamId, codec, width, height, scale}`. Sent on the video transport before its first frame of a stream and before RTC recovery keys. The viewer resets its decoder on a new `streamId` and ignores repeated configurations for the same stream on that connection. `codec` is a WebCodecs string (`avc1…`, `hev1…`, `vp09…`). |
| `0x02` | Video | `u8 flags` (bit 0 keyframe) `u16 seq` `u64 pts_us` then one encoded frame. `seq` numbers the frames of a stream from 0 in the order they are sent, restarting with each new stream; the page treats a gap as a lost frame and waits for the next keyframe. |
| `0x03` | Cursor | `u16 w` `u16 h` `i16 hot_x` `i16 hot_y` `u16 logical_w` `u16 logical_h` then straight-alpha RGBA; `w == 0` hides the pointer. The bitmap is `w × h`; it is shown at `logical_w × logical_h` logical pixels (larger for a client's HiDPI cursor, by buffer scale or viewport), the hotspot is logical, so the page uses `image-set(… (w/logical_w)x)`. |
| `0x04` | PointerLock | `u8 locked`: a client locked or released the pointer; the page mirrors it with the Pointer Lock API. |
| `0x05` | Audio | `u8 0` `u16 seq` `u64 pts_us` then one 20 ms Opus packet. `seq` counts every packet, sent or not. |
| `0x06` | Windows | JSON array of window objects (see below), the whole list, whenever anything in it changed. Replayed to a new viewer. |
| `0x07` | Clipboard | UTF-8 text a desktop application put on the clipboard (at most 1 MiB). Not replayed: a viewer that reconnects keeps its browser clipboard. |
| `0x08` | Role | `u8 role` `u8 features`: what this session may do. 0 watch only (the viewer token); 1 act but not drive (a control token while another session controls); 2 control: its pointer, keyboard and window size are the desktop's. `features` says what the desktop takes from the browser: bit 0 its microphone (`Mic`), bit 1 its webcam (`Cam`), bit 2 session playback is available. Sent with the replay after `Hello` and whenever it changes. |
| `0x09` | Notice | `u8 kind` (0 a warning, 1 good news) then UTF-8 text about the session's last action, for the page to show briefly. Sent to the controller when its drag (`Drag`) was dropped: good news naming the application that took the files, a warning when none did. Sent to a window stream whose press aims past the desktop's edge at an X11 window: Xwayland's screen is the desktop, and the X server pins the pointer to it, so that click cannot arrive. |
| `0x0A` | ClipboardData | A desktop application put something other than text on the clipboard; the payload is its mime type: `image/png` (the page fetches the bytes from `GET /api/clipboard` and writes them to the browser clipboard) or `text/uri-list` (files copied in a file manager: the page offers them for download). |
| `0x0B` | Notifications | JSON array of the open desktop notifications, oldest first, whenever they change and in the replay: each has `id`, `rev` (counts up when the application replaces it), `app`, `summary`, `body`, `icon` (whether `GET /api/notifications/{id}/icon` has a picture), `actions` as `[key, label]` pairs, and `timeout_ms` (0: until closed). |
| `0x0C` | StreamState | JSON `{"codec", "auto_codec", "preset", "ceiling_kbps", "medium_kbps", "bitrate_kbps", "max_fps", "effort"}`: selected preset and ceiling, configured Medium ceiling, and current encoder target (`max_fps` 0: the compositor's rate), when an encoder reports a new stream and whenever the rate controller steps the quality; the page separates ceiling, encoder target, and measured throughput. `effort` contains `requested`, nullable `applied`, nullable `encoder` and `setting`, and `pending`. Effort values are `fast`, `balanced`, or `high`; unavailable controls have null `applied` and `setting` with `pending: false`. |
| `0x0D` | Rtc | JSON, WebRTC signalling: `{"ice_servers": [...]}` right after the replay when the server does WebRTC (the page may then offer); `{"answer": "<sdp>", "g": 1}` to the page's offer, advertising numeric candidates for its endpoint unless `--rtc-addr` overrides it; `{"close": true, "g": 1}` when the server gives the channel up (pending video without SCTP acknowledgements for three seconds, or a message waiting three seconds at the application queue front): the video is already back on the socket, the page closes its side and retries while keeping WebRTC selected. A rejected offer returns the same close envelope with `"reason": "Offer rejected"`. `{"keyframe": true, "g": 1}` acknowledges a matching close that released a video claim and precedes a server-requested refresh; the page expects a keyframe even if its channel-open callback never ran. |
| `0x0E` | Fragment | On the data channel only: `u32 id` `u16 index` `u16 count` then up to 16 KiB of a Config or Video message, reassembled by id. The channel is ordered and reliable, so a piece is delayed rather than lost and nothing overtakes it; a frame the server dropped (its queue full, or a keyframe replacing what waited) shows as a seq gap and gets a keyframe. |
| `0x0F` | MixerState | JSON `{generation, available, error, routing, nodes}`: initial desktop audio snapshot and authoritative updates. Each node has an opaque `id`, `name`, nullable `application`, `kind` (`output`, `input`, `playback`, `recording`), `state`, nullable `volume` and `mute`, `volume_writable`, `mute_writable`, `routing_writable`, `targets` (IDs), `is_default`, `meter_before_volume`, `meter_active`, and nullable `meter_error`. Unavailable state invalidates rows; an error with `available: true` describes degraded service. |
| `0x10` | MixerLevels | JSON array of `{id, peak}`, at about 10 Hz to subscribed desktop viewers. Peaks are linear amplitudes measured from audio, shared across subscribers. |
| `0x11` | MixerError | UTF-8 error for the viewer's mixer command. |
| `0x12` | Session | `u64 id`: this desktop connection, used for conditional presentation handoff. |

Config and Video share the active transport's ordering. RTC queue replacement retains a Config
before the recovery key. While RTC owns video, the viewer ignores delayed WebSocket Video messages.
A new Config arriving over WebSocket closes the current RTC attempt before changing the decoder;
late RTC callbacks from that attempt are then ignored. Repeated Config messages for the current
stream on the same WebSocket session leave the decoder and sequence tracking intact. A reconnect
applies its configuration even if the stream ID repeats. On fallback, the server supplies the current
Config on WebSocket before video if that stream has not been configured on the socket.

### Client → server

| Type | Name | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| `0x80` | Auth | the token as UTF-8. First message. |
| `0x81` | Hello | `u8 hw` `u8 sw`: codec families the browser decodes with hardware, and at all (bit 0 H.264, bit 1 HEVC, bit 2 VP9, bit 3 AV1, bit 4 VP8); then `u8 codec` (0 Auto, else 1 H.264, 2 HEVC, 3 VP9, 4 AV1, 5 VP8) and `u8 quality` (1 very-low, 2 low, 3 medium, 4 high, 5 max; invalid means max), this viewer's choice; optional trailing `u8 effort` (0 fast, 1 balanced, 2 high; missing or invalid means fast). Picks the codec, among those this machine encodes, and starts the stream. |
| `0x82` | Resize | `u16 css_w` `u16 css_h` `f32 dpr`. Output = CSS size × dpr, rounded down to even, capped at 8K. |
| `0x83` | MotionAbs | `f32 x` `f32 y` in logical (CSS) pixels. |
| `0x84` | MotionRel | `f32 dx` `f32 dy` while pointer-locked. |
| `0x85` | Button | `u16 button` (Linux `BTN_*`: 0x110 left, 0x111 right, 0x112 middle, 0x113 side, 0x114 extra) `u8 pressed`. |
| `0x86` | Axis | `u8 deltaMode` (0 pixels, 1 lines, 2 pages) `f32 dx` `f32 dy`. Lines become wheel clicks (v120 = 120 per line); pixels become finger scrolling. |
| `0x87` | Key | `u16 evdev` `u8 pressed`. From `KeyboardEvent.code`; repeats are never sent. |
| `0x88` | RequestKeyframe | none. |
| `0x89` | Blur | none. Window blur, page hidden: releases every held key and button. |
| `0x8A` | PointerLockLost | none. The browser lost its lock (Escape): the client's lock is released and not re-taken until the next click or successful browser capture. |
| `0x8B` | Control | JSON control message (below). |
| `0x8C` | SetClipboard | UTF-8 text the browser pasted; it becomes the desktop clipboard, offered to Wayland and X11 clients. Control token only. A pasted image goes by `PUT /api/clipboard` instead. |
| `0x8D` | TakeControl | none. A control-token session becomes the controller; the desktop takes its size. |
| `0x8E` | Notify | JSON `{"id": N, "action": "default" \| "<key>"}`: the viewer clicked a notification or one of its actions; without `action` it dismissed it. Control token only. |
| `0x8F` | Stream | JSON `{"codec": "auto" \| "h264" \| "hevc" \| "vp9" \| "av1" \| "vp8", "quality": "very-low" \| "low" \| "medium" \| "high" \| "max", "effort": "fast" \| "balanced" \| "high"}`, all fields optional: this session's choice, applied live (a codec or effort change restarts the stream with a new id; a codec the browser or the server can't do means Auto). Any session, its own stream only. |
| `0x90` | Drag | JSON `{"op": "start"}`, `{"op": "drop", "batch": "…", "names": ["a.txt", …]}` or `{"op": "cancel"}` (with `"batch"` when files were staged for it): the browser drags local files over the desktop. `start` begins a drag on the desktop where the pointer is (offering `text/uri-list`, to copy or to move); the pointer messages move it; `drop` names the batch the files were staged in (`PUT /api/drop/{batch}/{name}` first, not the transfer folder) and their names, and drops their `file://` URIs on the application under the pointer; a drop nothing took, or a cancel naming a batch, sends the files to the transfer folder; `cancel` lets go over nothing. Controlling session only. |
| `0x91` | Input | JSON: one input action as `POST /api/input` takes it (`{"type": "text", "text": "…"}`, `{"type": "key", "keys": "ctrl+c"}`, `move`, `click`, …), resolved on the compositor thread, in order with the session's other input; the on-screen keyboard types with it. Controlling session only. |
| `0x92` | Touch | `u8 kind` (0 down, 1 motion, 2 up) `u8 id` `f32 x` `f32 y`: a finger on the browser's touchscreen, passed on as a `wl_touch` point (`id` tells the fingers down at once apart; logical px); each message is its own frame; a finger the browser takes for a gesture of its own is lifted. Controlling session only. |
| `0x93` | Mic | One Opus packet (20 ms, 48 kHz, mono) of the browser's microphone, played into the desktop's virtual source as it arrives. Controlling session only; dropped when the desktop has no audio. |
| `0x94` | Cam | One VP8 frame of the browser's webcam (720p at 30 fps asked of the camera, whatever it gives encoded at 2 Mbit/s with a keyframe every two seconds), played into the loopback camera as it arrives, scaled to 720p; when the desktop is behind, frames are dropped there until the next keyframe. Controlling session only; dropped without `--webcam`. |
| `0x95` | Rtc | JSON: `{"offer": "<sdp>", "g": 1, "endpoint": {"host": "<page hostname or IP>", "port": 8443}}` from the page to open its `video` data channel (ordered, reliable; the page sends the offer once its candidates are gathered, the server resolves the endpoint with a two-second DNS deadline and answers as an ICE-lite peer with numeric candidates for that endpoint. `--rtc-addr` ignores the endpoint and uses the configured address and UDP port; without the override, offers require an endpoint. The backend supplies numeric candidates for consistent browser support. An invalid or unresolvable endpoint returns a matching close with `"reason": "Page endpoint resolution failed"`); `{"close": true, "g": 1}` to go back to the socket. `g` is a required unsigned integer on offers and closes, numbering the attempt; it comes back with answers and server close notifications. A client close must carry the matching generation; it cannot close a newer attempt. While a session's channel is open its video frames and decoder configuration go there with the same message formats; other messages stay on the socket. Desktop and window sessions alike; the page offers while WebRTC is selected, initially and on recovery. Each attempt belongs to one WebSocket session. |
| `0x96` | Report | `u16 delay_ms` `u16 dropped`: the page's last second of video, once a second while frames come: how much later they arrived than at their best over the last ten seconds (the link queueing, which comes before it loses) and how many its decoder dropped. Either feeds the server's rate controller, which halves the bitrate under the viewer's quality ceiling and holds two seconds; five clean seconds raise it a quarter. |
| `0x97` | Mixer | JSON, at most 4096 bytes: `{op: "subscribe", enabled: bool}`, `{op: "volume", id, value}`, `{op: "mute", id, value}`, `{op: "target", id, target}`, or `{op: "default", id}`. Subscriptions are available to every authenticated desktop viewer; mutations require the current controller. Volume is finite 0–100 percent with cubic gain; mute is boolean; target is a compatible endpoint ID or null to follow the session default. Unknown fields, stale IDs and unsupported operations are rejected. Commands never accept a server address or native operation. |
| `0x98` | Handoff | `u64 target`: the current controller transfers to a live control-token desktop connection. Other senders, missing targets and viewer-token targets are ignored. |
| `0x99` | PointerLockGained | none. The browser acquired pointer lock; allow a pending application lock to resume without sending a button event. Driving sessions only. |

### Close codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 4001 | unauthorized: no or wrong token within five seconds, or the tokens were rotated |
| 4003 | a stream that can't run: no such window, the window closed, or no encoder could be made |

The page shows these (a token dialog for 4001, a card for 4003) and stops retrying; on any other close
it reconnects after a second.

### Viewers

Any number of sessions may watch the desktop at once; each has its own encoder, so each gets the
codec its browser decodes best and a stream scaled to fit its own window. One session at a time is the
**controller**: the first control-token session to connect, until it leaves (then the oldest
remaining control-token session) or another control-token session sends `TakeControl`. The
controller's pointer and keyboard messages drive the desktop, and its `Resize` sizes the output; the
others' pointer and keyboard messages are ignored and their `Resize` only sets the size their own
stream is scaled to (the output's aspect, never enlarged; the page letterboxes it). A control-token
session that isn't controlling still acts through `Control` and `SetClipboard`, and through the API;
a viewer-token session can't. Control changes send `Role` to the two sessions concerned and release
whatever the old controller held. `Session` identifies each desktop connection. `Handoff` uses the
same control-change path but checks ownership and the target under the session lock. PiP uses this
conditional transfer so a late presentation callback cannot displace another controller.

### Window streams (`/ws/window/{id}`)

One application window as its own video, for a tab or popup that shows just that window (the ↗ button in
the viewer's panel opens one, sized to the window). The same messages as `/ws`, with these differences:

- No `Resize` is needed: the stream is the window's geometry at the output's scale (even-rounded), and
  follows it. A `Resize` the page sends resizes the *window* to the given CSS size (a floating window
  only, like `resize` below).
- Pointer positions are relative to the window's geometry, as in the input message (they are forwarded
  as one, resolved against the live geometry). Keys and buttons go where they always go (the focused
  window, the pointer). Any control-token session drives its popup, whoever controls the desktop; a
  viewer-token session only watches. Focusing the tab activates the window.
- `Cursor`, `PointerLock`, `Windows` and `Clipboard` arrive as on `/ws`; there is no audio. The page
  uses the window list only for the tab title. `Notice` arrives only here: a press on the part of an
  X11 window that hangs past the desktop's edge, which Xwayland pins to the edge.
- Any number can run beside the viewer, each with its own encoder (one `--bitrate` each). The
  compositor renders a window stream only when that window changed; it drops the stream when the
  window closes (close code 4003) or the socket ends. `Hello` still picks the codec. A token rotation
  ends them all with 4001. A tab that stops reading for ten seconds is dropped, as is a viewer.

| Route | Result |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/windows` | JSON array of window objects (the list the viewer was last sent; `[]` before any). |

| `POST /api/control` | Body: a control message. `202 Accepted`; fire-and-forget. |
| `GET /api/windows/{id}/snapshot.png` | PNG of that window. Optional `width`, `height`, or `percentage`, default native dimensions; [sizing limits](desktop-api.md#screenshot-sizing). `400` invalid sizing. `404` unknown id, `429` another snapshot is in flight, `500` the render failed (logged), `503` the compositor didn't answer within 2 s. |
| `GET /api/screenshot.png` | PNG of the whole output (layers included, cursor excluded); sizing as for a window; `400`, `429`, `500`, `503` as for a window. |

| `GET /api/files?path=…` | Control token required. Paginated `FileListing`; required absolute directory path, `@home`, or `@transfer`. Optional `hidden`, `sort`, `desc`, `offset`, `limit`; [file operations](desktop-api.md#files). |
| `PUT /api/files/{name}?path=…` | Control token required. Streamed upload to the required directory; collisions add ` (2)` before the extension. `201` with `name`, `path`, and `directory`. |

| `DELETE /api/files/{name}?path=…` | Control token required. Nonrecursive unlink from the required directory. `204`; `404` missing. |
| `PUT /api/drop/{batch}/{name}` | Like `PUT /api/files/{name}`, but into batch `batch`, a directory under the cache directory named by a random id of the page's, for the application that will take the files in a drag or a paste (the `Drag` `drop` or `POST /api/clipboard/files` name the batch); batches are swept after a day. `201` with `{"name": "…"}`. |

Also on the server: `POST /mcp` (MCP over Streamable HTTP, same bearer token; see [mcp.md](mcp.md)) and
`GET /skill/SKILL.md`, `GET /skill/reference.md` (the agent documentation, no token). The generated
`skills/elsewhere/reference.md` holds the JSON schemas of every body and tool.

### Window object

```json
{"id": 3, "title": "…", "app_id": "org.gnome.Calculator", "icon": "org.gnome.Calculator", "content": null, "x11": false, "pid": 4242,
 "x": 70, "y": 70, "w": 360, "h": 616, "geo_x": 26, "geo_y": 23, "popups": [[12, 40, 200, 310]], "decoration": 0, "z": 1,
 "maximized": false, "fullscreen": false, "minimized": false, "focused": true,
 "updated_ms": 34044000, "content_revision": 42}
```

- `id` is stable for the window's life and never reused.
- `app_id` is the X11 `WM_CLASS` for X11 windows; `pid` comes from the socket credentials (Wayland) or `_NET_WM_PID` (X11), when known.
- `x y w h` is the xdg geometry in logical pixels. For a minimized window it is where the window will come back.
- `geo_x geo_y` is where that geometry sits inside the client's own surface (the width of its client-side shadow), 0 for X11 windows.
- `popups` lists the window's open popups (menus, combo box lists, tooltips) as `[x, y, w, h]` relative to `x y`; always empty for X11 windows.
- `decoration` is the height of the title bar the compositor draws above `x y w h` (32), or 0 when the
  application draws its own. That bar and its buttons are part of the window's elements (below).
- `z` is the stacking index, 0 = bottom, over the listed windows; `null` while minimized. Menus and tooltips (X11 override-redirect) are not listed.
- `focused` is the compositor's intent: the window last activated by a click, the taskbar or the API.
- `updated_ms` is the time of the window's last applied commit on the compositor's monotonic clock, in milliseconds. `content_revision` increases for applied content commits and changes to captured geometry or surface membership. It is an invalidation signal, not a pixel comparison. Content-only lists are coalesced to at most four per second, with the final revision published even after drawing stops. Structural list changes publish immediately.

### Input message

```json
{"type": "click", "window": 3, "x": 549, "y": 47}          {"type": "click", "x": 700, "y": 400, "button": "right", "count": 2}
{"type": "move", "x": 10, "y": 10}                          {"type": "button", "button": "left", "pressed": true}
{"type": "scroll", "dy": 3}                                 {"type": "key", "keys": "ctrl+shift+t"}
{"type": "text", "text": "hello\n"}
```

- Coordinates are output logical pixels, or relative to the window's geometry when `window` is given
  (the same origin as element rectangles). `click` moves the pointer first; `count` is 1 to 3.
- `key` is a `+`-separated chord: `ctrl`, `shift`, `alt`, `super`, then any xkb keysym name (`Return`,
  `Escape`, `F5`, `Prior`) or a single character (letters are case-insensitive). Pressed in order,
  released in reverse; keys a viewer already holds stay held; a chord with a key the layout lacks does nothing.
- `text` is typed through the compositor's keyboard layout, Shift or AltGr where the layout needs it;
  `\n` is Return; characters the layout can't produce are skipped with a warning in the log.
- `scroll` is in wheel lines (positive `dy` down), sent like the viewer's wheel.

`node web/checks/structured-input.mjs` checks text and key chords against a real
terminal in the Docker rig, through desktop and window WebSockets. Both viewer-token
paths reject input. Keys follow the compositor's current keyboard focus in both streams.

### Elements object

 "elements": [{"role": "button", "name": "Save As…", "x": 549, "y": 47, "w": 107, "h": 34}, …]}
```

- `level`: `none` (the application publishes no tree), `app` (it does, but no toplevel of it matches this
  window), `frame` (the toplevel is there but empty; Chromium without `--force-renderer-accessibility`),
  `full`. `elements` is empty below `full`.
- `toolkit` as the application names it (`GTK`, `gtk`, `Gecko`, `Chromium`, …), when it says.
- `role` is one of `button`, `toggle`, `switch`, `checkbox`, `radio`, `link`, `entry`, `text`,
  `password`, `combobox`, `menu`, `menuitem`, `tab`, `slider`, `spinbutton`, `listitem`, `treeitem`,
  `scrollbar`, `heading`. Containers and static text are not listed.
- `x y w h` are logical pixels relative to the window's `x y`, so `x + window.x` is where to click. Only
  elements that are showing and have a size are listed; at most 500, from a walk of at most 3000 nodes.
  Items of an open menu are placed at the menu's popup (see `popups` on the window object).
  When the compositor decorates the window (`decoration` > 0), the list ends with its title bar (role
  `title bar`, the window's title as `name`) and its three buttons (`push button`: `Minimize`,
  `Maximize` or `Restore`, `Close`), at `y = -32` above the geometry; they are there at every `level`.

### Control message

`{"id": <window id>, "op": "<op>", ...}`; `id` is omitted for `spawn`, `launch` and `quit`.

| `op` | Effect |
|---|---|
| `activate` | unminimize if needed, raise, focus |
| `close` | ask the client to close (`xdg_toplevel.close` / `WM_DELETE_WINDOW`) |
| `minimize`, `unminimize` | |
| `maximize`, `unmaximize`, `fullscreen`, `unfullscreen` | through the same paths as the client's own requests; a minimized window is restored first |
| `move` (`x`, `y`) | floating windows only (mapped, not maximized or fullscreen) |
| `resize` (`w`, `h`) | floating windows only; a size hint for Wayland clients, a configure for X11 |
| `spawn` (`cmd`) | `sh -c cmd` with the `--exec` environment: `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY`, `PULSE_SINK`, `XDG_SESSION_TYPE` and the toolkits' backend switches |
| `launch` (`app`) | start an installed application: `app` is an `id` from `GET /api/applications`, its `Exec` line runs like `spawn`; `404` over HTTP for an unknown id |
| `quit` | Elsewhere exits, every window with it |

Unknown ids and impossible requests are ignored. `spawn` is remote code execution by design; the token
is the boundary.

### Applications

`GET /api/applications` lists the launchers of the `.desktop` files in the XDG data directories
(`$XDG_DATA_HOME`, `$XDG_DATA_DIRS`; the first directory that has a file wins, so a user's copy hides a
system entry): `id` (the file name without `.desktop`), `name`, `comment`, `categories`. Entries that a
menu would not show are left out: `NoDisplay`, `Hidden`, `OnlyShowIn` (meant for one desktop), `Terminal`
(nothing to run them in), and `TryExec` binaries that aren't installed. `GET /api/applications/{id}/icon`
is the entry's icon as SVG or PNG, from the icon themes (hicolor first) or `pixmaps`; `404` without one.

## Browser console

`window.elsewhere()` returns viewer statistics. `elsewhere.windows()`, `elsewhere.activate(id)`, `elsewhere.control({...})`,
`elsewhere.spawn(cmd)`, `elsewhere.launch(app)`, `elsewhere.quit()`, `elsewhere.snapshot(id, sizing)` (a `Blob`) and `elsewhere.elements(id)` wrap the
same messages and routes.

The Docker rig can run `node web/checks/rtc-peer.mjs` for peer disposal and signaling callbacks,
`node web/checks/rtc-endpoint.mjs` for page IP/hostname/port selection and explicit overrides, and
`node web/checks/quality.mjs` for live desktop/window transport and quality.
`node web/checks/rtc-recovery.mjs` exercises real channels, fallback, retry and cancellation;
run that check with NET_ADMIN inside Docker so it can temporarily block its test server's UDP port.
It removes its dedicated firewall chain on exit.

`FILE_RESULT` (`0x13`) carries UTF-8 JSON `{batch, saved, failed, error}` after an unclaimed or
cancelled desktop drop is rescued. `saved` contains `{name,path,directory}` objects. Control-token
sessions receive it; the originating client matches its batch ID and offers navigation explicitly.
It carries an operation result, not a directory subscription.
