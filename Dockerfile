# elsewhere with the default Xfce apps, the Xfce panel, Firefox and Chromium, and applications for
# what the desktop can do (guvcview for the webcam, Audacity, GIMP, mpv with VA-API decode, Ristretto,
# pavucontrol), with nano
# and a passwordless sudo for the `elsewhere` user, on Arch Linux.
#
#   make docker-run          builds the image and runs it (the two commands below)
#   docker build -t elsewhere .
#   docker run --rm --device /dev/dri --shm-size 1g -p 8443:8443 -p 8443:8443/udp -v elsewhere-data:/home/elsewhere/.config/elsewhere elsewhere
#
# The desktop starts empty: the viewer's own menu lists the installed applications and launches them,
# and its power menu shuts elsewhere down. To have the Xfce panel as well, add
# `--exec xfce4-panel` after the image name. Without a usable GPU encoder, add `--software-encoding`
# (rendering still uses the GPU); without any GPU, drop `--device /dev/dri`: llvmpipe renders and the CPU
# encodes. For the browser's webcam, load v4l2loopback on the host
# and add `--device /dev/videoN --group-add $(stat -c %g /dev/videoN)` to docker run and `--webcam /dev/videoN`
# after the image name.
# Open a plain https://<host>:8443/ URL from the startup log and accept the self-signed certificate
# after checking its fingerprint. Create an admin token with
# `docker exec <container> elsewhere token create --admin` and paste it into the connection dialog.
# The volume preserves the SQLite token registry and certificates across runs.
# Any number of viewers can connect; one controls at a time.
# Arguments after the image name go to elsewhere, e.g. `... elsewhere --codecs h264`.
# If /dev/dri/renderD128 isn't world-accessible on the host, add `--group-add $(stat -c %g /dev/dri/renderD128)`.
# Hardware encoding uses the host GPU through VA-API: Intel (iHD) and AMD (Mesa) drivers are included,
# as are Mesa's OpenGL and Vulkan drivers for both. To check them from the desktop: `glxinfo -B`,
# `vulkaninfo --summary`, and `glxgears` / `vkcube --wsi wayland` as spinning windows (spawn them
# from a terminal or the API).

# The viewer (React, built by Vite into web/dist); the binary embeds it.
