# Elsewhere

A headless Wayland compositor whose screen is a browser tab. Clients render on the GPU, the
composited frame is hardware-encoded with VA-API (AV1, HEVC, VP9 or H.264, whichever the browser
decodes best and the GPU encodes) and streamed over a WebSocket, and the browser decodes it with
WebCodecs. Mouse, keyboard, audio and the clipboard travel the same way.

## Install

Releases made from `vX.Y.Z` tags carry separate native packages and tarballs for Debian stable,
Ubuntu 24.04 and current Ubuntu, plus an Arch package. Choose the artifact for your distribution;
FFmpeg shared-library ABIs differ between releases.
Building from source needs Rust stable, Node 24 for the viewer, Clang, pkg-config and the development
packages for FFmpeg, libva, PipeWire, libgbm, libEGL and libxkbcommon; `make` builds the viewer and then
`target/release/elsewhere`. `make version` reports the nearest reachable `vX.Y.Z` release tag,
adding `.N` for commits since that tag and `-dirty` for tracked changes or untracked files.
For example, three commits after `v0.1.2` produce `v0.1.2.3`, or `v0.1.2.3-dirty` with local changes.
Ignored build outputs do not make a checkout dirty. Fetch tags and full history before building;
shallow checkouts and checkouts with no reachable release tag cannot derive a version. Plain Cargo builds report `0.0.0-dev` unless
`ELSEWHERE_VERSION` is set.

`make package-deb`, `make package-tar` and `make package-arch` build into `dist`. Debian needs
`cargo-deb` and the Debian packaging tools; Arch needs `makepkg` and a non-root build user. The release
workflow uses these same targets on their native distributions. Tarball filenames include the build distribution. They and the binary's
`--version` retain the Git version. Debian and Arch metadata and package filenames omit `v`, spell
`-dirty` as `.dirty`, and add package revision `-1`, so `v0.1.2.3-dirty` becomes
`0.1.2.3.dirty-1` in both packages and their filenames.
The Arch `PKGBUILD` in `packaging/arch` also derives the version when used directly.
Package targets always derive their version from Git. `make check-version` runs the version fixtures
with Python 3 and Git; run it in the Docker rig.
After installing a native package in a disposable Docker container, run
`python3 scripts/check-package-tls.py` from a checkout as root, with Python and OpenSSL installed,
to check the broadcast helper's trusted, untrusted and wrong-host TLS connections.

## Requirements

- Linux, with a GPU render node (`/dev/dri/renderD128`) and Mesa for hardware rendering and encoding, or
  none at all (Mesa's llvmpipe renders and the CPU encodes; see below).
- FFmpeg 6.1 or later, with VAAPI support for hardware encoding. `--software-encoding` uses
  libvpx, x264 or OpenH264, x265, and libaom, according to the installed FFmpeg build.
  Software encoding runs the desktop at 30 Hz. Standard distribution FFmpeg packages supply these
  libraries; codec availability is checked by opening an encoder and producing a keyframe.
- `ca-certificates` supplies the system trust store for verified RTMPS broadcasts. Native packages
  require it; install it separately when using a tarball.
- `xorg-xwayland` for X11 clients. Audio requires PipeWire 1.4.2+, its Pulse compatibility service,
  WirePlumber 0.5.6+ and `pactl`. See [session audio](docs/session-audio.md)
  for packages and host-service compatibility. `--no-audio` needs no audio services; the native PipeWire client library remains a runtime dependency.
- Rust stable and Node 24 to build. The browser needs WebCodecs (Chromium, Firefox 130+, Safari 26+).

## Run

```sh
make run ARGS="--exec foot"                   # any Wayland client; WAYLAND_DISPLAY is set for it
```

(`make web` once, then plain `cargo run --release -- --exec foot` works too.)

The server prints its certificate fingerprint and plain connection URLs, without tokens. Open a URL
in a browser, compare the fingerprint before accepting the self-signed certificate, and paste a token
into the connection dialog. Retrieve an existing token on the server with:

```sh
elsewhere token           # control access
elsewhere token --viewer  # read-only access
```

Use the same user and environment as the running server. Tokens are stored in
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/elsewhere/token` and `viewer-token`, or `~/.config/elsewhere/` when
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset. The command only reads the selected file; it does not start the server,
create files or rotate tokens. Start the server once to create tokens. In Docker, run
`docker exec <container> elsewhere token`, adding `--viewer` for read-only access.

The desktop takes the size of the controlling viewer's display area; the fullscreen button hands it the whole screen, with
keyboard lock so shortcuts like Ctrl+W reach the desktop.

Any number of people can watch at once, each with a stream scaled to their own window. The first to
connect with the control token drives the pointer and keyboard; anyone else with that token sees a
"Take control" button, and the desktop then takes their window's size. Anyone using the view-only token
can watch, read the window list and elements, and take snapshots, but not act.

Use `--screen-size 1920x1080` to set a fixed desktop resolution from startup. Browser resizes and
control handoffs keep that resolution; each browser scales the picture to fit while preserving its
aspect ratio. Both dimensions must be even and between 2 and 8192 pixels. Without this option, the
desktop follows the controlling browser's size.

Each viewer picks its own codec, quality and encoding effort in the status bar: the codec list is what both the server
and that browser can do ("Auto (HEVC)" shows the pick). All five quality levels adapt under their
selected ceiling: Very Low (2 Mbit/s), Low (5), Medium (`--bitrate`, 8 by default), High (12), and
Max (25). Max is the default. The stream starts at its ceiling; under pressure the server halves the
bitrate and holds it, then climbs back a quarter at a time. Targets below 3 Mbit/s have a 30 fps cap.
The status bar shows the selected ceiling and current stream target separately from measured video
throughput. A custom Medium ceiling is displayed as configured, even if it exceeds another level.
Effort defaults to Fast. Balanced and High spend more encoding time for possible picture improvements
at the same bitrate. Changes restart the viewer's stream immediately and are remembered on reconnect;
unsupported encoder controls show unavailable. See [encoding effort](docs/encoding-effort.md) for
mappings and measured tradeoffs.
`GET /api/codecs` lists the server's codecs. After the picture stops changing one more frame
encodes the settled picture at the current target so text left rough by motion can sharpen.
Frames are painted on a 2D canvas. `?renderer=webgpu` in the URL uses a WebGPU external-texture path
instead; it is opt-in because Chromium on Linux occasionally presents a blank frame that way, which looks like flicker.

Windows that don't draw their own title bar (X11 applications, Vulkan and SDL programs, anything that
asks for server-side decorations) get one from the compositor: drag it, double-click it to maximize,
resize from the edges, close, maximize and minimize with its buttons.

Other clients can join later: `WAYLAND_DISPLAY=elsewhere some-app`. X11 apps work too: an
Xwayland is started automatically and the log prints its `DISPLAY`. Super (or Alt) + left drag moves
any window from anywhere in it.

Each desktop owns a private PipeWire server, Pulse compatibility service and WirePlumber policy.
Startup commands, menu/API launches and their descendants receive the private audio socket selectors.
Applications play into the session output, which is encoded as 48 kHz stereo Opus for the browser.
The viewer's microphone button sends the controlling browser's microphone into the session microphone.
Stopping capture stops the browser's recording indicator and leaves silence for recording applications.

Open **Mixer** in the status bar for session devices and individual application streams, with actual
peak meters, volume and mute. Read-only viewers can inspect; the controlling viewer changes the shared
session. Muting the session microphone does not stop browser capture. With multiple session endpoints,
the mixer also offers routing and default selection through WirePlumber.

`--no-audio` starts no audio services. Audio startup or service failure leaves the desktop running with
audio unavailable. Shutdown stops the audio workers before the private services. For clients launched
separately, use the connection variables printed in the log. See [session audio](docs/session-audio.md)
for the device names, environment and lifecycle.

The browser's webcam works the same way through a `v4l2loopback` device, the one kind of camera every
application understands: on the host, `modprobe v4l2loopback exclusive_caps=1 card_label=elsewhere`
(the package is `v4l2loopback-dkms` on most distributions) and start the server with `--webcam
/dev/videoN` (the device it made; in Docker add `--device /dev/videoN --group-add $(stat -c %g /dev/videoN)`
to `docker run`). The camera button in the status bar then sends the webcam as VP8, scaled to 720p, to
that device, which video calls in the desktop pick as a camera. With `exclusive_caps=1`, the loopback
advertises only video output until it receives frames. Turn the browser camera on before starting a
call so the application can discover it.
In the Docker image, the guvcview menu entry uses the device selected by `--webcam`. Enable the
browser camera before launching guvcview. If it was opened early, close it and relaunch after enabling
the camera. Applications launched by the compositor receive the configured device in `ELSEWHERE_WEBCAM_DEVICE`.
Without `--webcam` (or if the device can't be opened, which the log says) there is no button.

`--exec` runs at startup with the environment of a Wayland session (`XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, the toolkits'
backend switches, `DISPLAY` for X11 programs), and `--kiosk` fullscreens every window. Together they run a whole nested desktop; with the
`mutter-devkit` package installed, GNOME:

```sh
cargo run --release -- --kiosk --exec 'dbus-run-session -- gnome-shell --devkit'
```

Applications launched by the desktop inherit `GSK_RENDERER` and `QT_QPA_PLATFORM` from the
Elsewhere process. Set them in its launcher environment when needed:

```sh
GSK_RENDERER=ngl QT_QPA_PLATFORM='wayland;xcb' elsewhere
```

`GSK_RENDERER=ngl` selects GTK's GL renderer to work around intermittent thin dark triangles
with GTK 4.22's Vulkan renderer, including the nested shell's GTK viewer.
`QT_QPA_PLATFORM='wayland;xcb'` makes Qt try Wayland, then X11 for builds without a Wayland plugin.
For Docker, pass `-e GSK_RENDERER=ngl -e 'QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland;xcb'` before the image name.
Without these settings, applications choose their toolkit defaults.

The devkit's window follows the browser size. Don't add `--virtual-monitor`: that adds a second
monitor, and GNOME puts its top bar only on the first one.

Panels work without a nested desktop: the compositor speaks wlr-layer-shell and
wlr-foreign-toplevel-management, so waybar and xfce4-panel run as ordinary clients with working
taskbars (maximized windows stay clear of the panels, minimize goes through the taskbar).

```sh
cargo run --release -- --exec 'waybar & exec foot'                              # add "wlr/taskbar" to modules-left for a taskbar
cargo run --release -- --exec 'dbus-run-session -- sh -c "xfce4-panel & exec foot"'   # first run asks for the default config
```

xfce4-panel needs a D-Bus session bus for xfconfd; the wrapper is only needed where there is none.
 Its pager shows the single workspace. Waybar's default config draws its
icons with Font Awesome (`otf-font-awesome`); GTK only shows icons in the Xfce menus with
`gtk-menu-images=1` in `~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini`, which xfsettingsd normally sets. Windows
that draw their own title bar (GTK applications, Firefox, Chromium) take its buttons from the GSettings
key `org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout`, whose GNOME default is `appmenu:close`; without
a desktop that sets it, minimize and maximize are missing until you do:

```sh
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences button-layout 'menu:minimize,maximize,close'
```

The `Dockerfile` packages all of that on Arch Linux: Elsewhere, the Xfce panel and apps,
Firefox and Chromium, applications for what the desktop can do (guvcview for the webcam, Audacity, GIMP,
mpv with VA-API decode, Ristretto, pavucontrol), nano and a passwordless sudo for the `elsewhere` user, with PipeWire for audio and
Mesa's OpenGL and Vulkan drivers for Intel and AMD (`glxgears`, `vkcube` and the info tools are included
to check them), and the two GTK settings above. Programs launched from the desktop start in the home folder.
The desktop starts empty; the viewer's menu launches the applications, and `--exec xfce4-panel` after
the image name adds the panel. `make docker-run` builds the image and runs it; the details are
in the Dockerfile's header.

The page says when the server closed its socket with a token dialog ("wrong token" or "token
rotated"; the tokens change with the data directory, e.g. a fresh container without a volume).

In Settings, enable **Capture mouse on click** for games that use edge scrolling. The first click
captures the mouse; movement, clicks, and the mouse wheel reach the desktop only while captured.
Use the application's fullscreen button to send normal Escape presses to the remote application
while keeping the mouse captured in supported browsers. Hold Escape to use the browser's release
gesture. Outside supported fullscreen, normal Escape may release capture; browser-only F11 fullscreen
does not enable this behavior. The setting is remembered in your browser and starts off.
Games that request pointer lock still capture automatically; after the browser releases capture, click to resume.

## Reverse proxies

Use `--url-prefix /elsewhere/alice` to host an instance beneath a path, including nested paths.
By default the proxy preserves the prefix; add `--proxy-strips-prefix` when it removes it.
[Reverse proxy setup](docs/reverse-proxy.md) covers both nginx modes, multiple instances under one
HTTPS hostname, TLS termination with `--no-tls`, and separate UDP ports for optional WebRTC.

## Transport

The video travels on the WebSocket. A viewer can move it to a WebRTC data channel (UDP, ordered and
reliable) with the Transport select in the status bar. The page offers and the server answers with
candidates for the page's hostname and port, with `--rtc-port` overriding the port and `--rtc-addr` overriding the address. The frames move to the channel once it opens; input, audio, events and the signalling
stay on the WebSocket either way, so the socket is needed whatever carries the video.

The server paces data-channel fragments according to each viewer's stream target to limit bursts.
The channel remains ordered and reliable: missing packets can hold up later video until SCTP
retransmits them. Lost frames or arrival gaps over half a second caused by the link in three of ten
seconds trigger fallback to the socket. Pending video with no byte acknowledgements for three
seconds, or a frame waiting that long at the server queue's front, also triggers fallback. Encoder
restarts preserve the acknowledgement deadline. An idle channel stays open.
See [stream reliability](docs/stream-reliability.md) for the controlled-link checks and measurements.

The selected transport stays WebRTC during fallback. Socket video continues while a fresh channel
connects. Failed attempts retry with jittered exponential delays of about 1 to 30 seconds; ten seconds
without channel loss or stalls resets the backoff. Each attempt has a ten-second total budget.
The status bar shows the actual path and recovery state, with Retry now while waiting. Statistics
also shows the reason, retry count and next attempt. Selecting WebSocket cancels recovery. A server
or browser without WebRTC support stays on the socket without retrying, preserving the preference.
Quality selection and its adaptive ceiling are independent of transport recovery.

The server listens on UDP on the listen port's number. `--rtc-port` sets both the local and advertised UDP port while keeping the browser's hostname.
By default, the browser sends WebRTC traffic to the page's hostname and port. The backend resolves
the hostname to IP addresses for ICE, so the hostname must resolve to the reachable address from
inside the container too. Use `--rtc-addr` if the browser and backend see different DNS results.
An omitted page port means 443 for HTTPS or 80 for HTTP. Docker needs both TCP and UDP published, for example `-p 8443:8443 -p 8443:8443/udp`. If the page uses a different
external port, publish UDP on that same external port too.

When UDP uses a different port from the page, such as behind an HTTPS-only proxy, set
`--rtc-port` and forward that port unchanged. Set `--rtc-addr <reachable IP>` only to override the hostname. This advertises that IP with `--rtc-port`,
or the listen port's number if omitted; the advertised UDP port must be forwarded unchanged.
For browsers behind a strict NAT give them a STUN server (`--stun stun:host:3478`) or a TURN server (`--turn turn:host:3478 --turn-user …
--turn-pass …`, its address as the browsers reach it). coturn is one container to self-host:

```sh
docker run -d --name turn -p 3478:3478/udp -p 3478:3478 -p 49160-49200:49160-49200/udp coturn/coturn \
  -n --lt-cred-mech --user=USER:PASS --realm=elsewhere --listening-port=3478 \
  --min-port=49160 --max-port=49200 --relay-ip=<the address the server reaches it at>
```

`--no-rtc` leaves the option out entirely.

## Without a GPU

On a machine with no `/dev/dri` at all (a VPS, a CI runner, a container started without devices) the
server renders with Mesa's llvmpipe through the surfaceless EGL platform and encodes on the CPU: pass
`--render-node none`, or nothing (a default node that isn't there means the same). Frames are read back
into memory for the software encoders, clients draw into shared memory (there is no dmabuf global to
offer them GPU buffers), and X11 clients render in software too. The same binary with the node present
behaves as before. If the surfaceless platform picks a GPU driver you don't want, `LIBGL_ALWAYS_SOFTWARE=1`
in the environment forces llvmpipe.

## Files

The Files tab browses the remote filesystem with the server process's Unix permissions. It starts in
Downloads (`--files-dir` selects another transfer folder). Each viewer chooses its own directory.
Upload and page drops outside the desktop use that directory; navigation during a batch cannot change
its destination. Browse folders, download files, create directories, rename entries, and confirm file
deletion. Home, transfer-folder shortcuts, breadcrumbs, sorting, and hidden files are available.
Listings load on navigation, Refresh, and this viewer's own changes to the displayed directory.
Reopening the panel or changes from another viewer do not refresh it. File access requires a control
token, including the API; read-only viewers have no Files tab or file download controls.
Drag a file over the desktop itself and the application under the pointer sees a drag coming; let go and,
once the file is uploaded, it is dropped there as a `file://` URI, to copy or to move. Since the
application picks the folder, such a file is not uploaded to Downloads but staged under the cache
directory (`~/.cache/elsewhere/drops`, a folder with a random name per drop): Thunar moves it out into
the folder shown, Nautilus copies, an editor opens it where it is, and whatever is left there is swept after
a day (an editor still showing the file loses it then).
A drop no application took is copied to the transfer folder. The result shows saved names and offers
Open folder without changing the selected directory. Files copied in a file manager inside the desktop
show up in the status bar with a download button, and files copied on your machine paste into the
desktop's file manager, staged the same way.

## Phones and tablets

The page works on a phone. Fingers reach applications as real touch points (`wl_touch`; X11
applications get XI2 touch through Xwayland), so a map pans with one finger and zooms with two, and a
drawn title bar drags with a finger. The hand button switches to "touch as mouse" for applications that
handle touch badly: a tap clicks, a finger drags, a hold of half a second right-clicks, two fingers
scroll, and a pinch zooms the picture on the phone (the desktop keeps the phone's size; two fingers pan
while zoomed, pinching back undoes it). The side panel slides over the stage, the top bar
keeps its icons, and on touch devices a keyboard button opens a row with a field that brings up the
phone's keyboard, whose text goes through the desktop's keyboard layout, and the keys such keyboards
lack: Esc, Tab, Ctrl, Alt and Super (sticky, for the next key), the arrows, Del. Fullscreen works where
the browser allows it (Android; iOS Safari has no fullscreen for pages, and needs Safari 26 for
WebCodecs).

## Window streams

The ↗ button on a window's row in the panel opens it in a popup of its own, streaming only that window
(`/?window=ID`): the pointer, keyboard and clipboard work there as in the viewer, resizing the popup
resizes the window, and the popup reports when the window closes. Each such popup has its own encoder.

Picture-in-picture is also available in supporting browsers on a secure origin. The top-bar action
opens the whole desktop; a window row's action opens that application. One PiP window belongs to each
opener, with a compact title/status bar and Return to main viewer. Choosing another target replaces its
content. Ordinary popups remain available.

When you control the desktop, control and its dimensions follow the PiP viewport. Returning, or taking
control in the main viewer, returns that presentation to the main window. Another viewer's control is
not displaced just by opening or closing PiP. Desktop playback moves to PiP; microphone and camera
capture stop on handoff and must be restarted explicitly in the main viewer. Window PiP has no audio.
PiP cannot use fullscreen keyboard capture. Use the keyboard row for desktop composition input and
return to the normal viewer for copied-file downloads or capture controls. Browser checks and known
interaction limits are recorded in [the desktop UI notes](docs/desktop-api.md#document-picture-in-picture).

## Desktop API

The compositor is the window manager, so the viewer and outside scripts can see and drive the desktop.
HTTP calls send the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`; the viewer page takes it from its URL
fragment once (`#token=`, never sent to the server), keeps it in `sessionStorage` and drops it from the
address bar, and sends it as the first message on its WebSocket. A tab without a token shows a dialog
asking for one. There are no cookies and a token is never in a URL the server sees. The view-only token
works for everything below that reads (the window list, elements, snapshots, the clipboard, copied files
included) and
gets `403` for everything that acts. `POST /api/token/rotate` (with the control token) issues new
tokens: the files, the API and every viewer switch at once. The API returns the new tokens;
`elsewhere token` reads the updated files. Token values are not printed to server output.

```sh
T=$(elsewhere token)
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" http://host:8443/api/windows | jq        # the window list
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     http://host:8443/api/control -d '{"id":3,"op":"minimize"}'                # act on a window
curl -X POST ... /api/control -d '{"op":"spawn","cmd":"firefox"}'             # start a program
curl -o w.png -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" 'http://host:8443/api/windows/3/snapshot.png?percentage=50'
curl -o screen.png -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" http://host:8443/api/screenshot.png
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $T" http://host:8443/api/windows/3/elements | jq   # with --elements
curl -X POST ... /api/input -d '{"type":"click","window":3,"x":549,"y":47}'  # click an element
curl -X POST ... /api/input -d '{"type":"text","text":"hello"}'                 # type; also key, scroll, move, button
```

Each window reports `id`, `title`, `app_id`, `icon` (with the picture at `/api/windows/{id}/icon`), `content`
(`video`, `game` or `photo` when the client says so), `x11`, `pid`, its geometry `x y w h` in logical pixels, where
that geometry sits in the client's surface (`geo_x geo_y`), its open `popups` (`[x, y, w, h]` relative to
the geometry), the height of the title bar the compositor draws above it (`decoration`, 0 when the
application draws its own), its stacking index `z` (`null` while minimized), `maximized`, `fullscreen`,
`minimized`, `focused`, `updated_ms` on the compositor clock, and monotonic `content_revision` for preview invalidation. Ops: `activate`, `close`, `minimize`, `unminimize`, `maximize`,
`unmaximize`, `fullscreen`, `unfullscreen`, `move` (`x`, `y`), `resize` (`w`, `h`), `spawn` (`cmd`, run
with `sh -c` in the same environment as `--exec`), `launch` (`app`, an id from `GET /api/applications`,
the installed `.desktop` launchers, whose icons are at `/api/applications/{id}/icon`) and `quit`, which
ends Elsewhere. Requests are fire-and-forget; unknown ids are ignored.
Snapshots are lossless PNGs of a window's own buffers, so they include covered and minimized windows.
Omitted sizing returns native dimensions. Supply one of `width`, `height`, or
`percentage`; see [sizing limits](docs/desktop-api.md#screenshot-sizing).

With `--elements`, `/api/windows/{id}/elements` lists a window's UI elements (buttons, links, text fields,
tabs, menu items, …) with role, name and rectangle relative to the window, so a script or an agent can
target a control instead of interpreting pixels. It reads the toolkits' accessibility trees over the D-Bus
session Elsewhere was started in (`dbus-run-session -- elsewhere --elements …` if there is
none; the container does this). GTK and Qt applications and Firefox publish their trees when started from
`--exec` or `spawn`; Chromium and Electron apps need `--force-renderer-accessibility`. Without the flag
the route answers `501`; `503` means the tree couldn't be read (no bus, or the application went away).

`/api/input` clicks, types, presses key chords and scrolls as a user would, with coordinates relative to a
window when you pass its id, so element rectangles can be used as they are. `/api/clipboard` reads what an
application last copied, text or a PNG, and sets what it will paste; the viewer page bridges the same
clipboard to the browser's (copy text or an image in an application, paste locally; Ctrl+V in the page
pastes the browser's clipboard, screenshots included).

The status bar's clipboard button opens a preview of the desktop clipboard. Text can be selected,
edited or cleared; images have a bounded preview, and copied files have download buttons. An unfinished
text draft survives closing the panel. If another application copies while you edit, the panel lets
you load that content or replace it with your draft. Opening the panel does not change the browser's
clipboard. View-only sessions can inspect permitted content but cannot edit it or download copied files.

## Agents: MCP and skill

The same operations are MCP tools at `/mcp` (Streamable HTTP, same bearer token), so a coding agent can
drive the desktop: `windows`, `elements`, `snapshot`, `screenshot`, `window_control`, `move_window`,
`resize_window`, `applications`, `launch`, `spawn`, `click`, `move_pointer`, `button`, `scroll`, `key`,
`type`, `clipboard_read`, `clipboard_write`.

```sh
claude mcp add --transport http elsewhere https://host:8443/mcp --header "Authorization: Bearer $T"
ELSEWHERE_TOKEN=$T codex mcp add elsewhere --url https://host:8443/mcp --bearer-token-env-var ELSEWHERE_TOKEN
```

The server hands the agent its manual on connection (`skills/elsewhere/SKILL.md`) and the
generated `reference.md` with every route, body and tool schema; both are also served at `/skill/`
without a token and can be copied into an agent's skills directory. With a self-signed certificate,
point the agent at the fingerprint the server prints, or run `--no-tls` behind a reverse proxy.

The viewer page uses the same data over its WebSocket: its application menu lists the installed
programs by category, with a search box, and starts them; its side panel lists the windows with thumbnails
and open-in-popup, snapshot, maximize, minimize and close buttons (click a row to bring the window
forward, type in the box at the top to run a command), its Statistics tab shows the stream's numbers
(per-stage timings, drops, audio lead) once a second. **Settings → Overlays** in the top bar controls
local coloured window outlines and the focused window's accessibility-element outlines. Both apply
immediately and are remembered. UI elements requires server accessibility support (`--elements`).
The power menu quits Elsewhere. Desktop notifications appear as toasts with their actions;
Elsewhere is the session's notification daemon when no other runs. A panel is optional. In the browser console,
`elsewhere.windows()`, `elsewhere.activate(id)`, `elsewhere.control({...})`, `elsewhere.spawn(cmd)`, `elsewhere.snapshot(id)` and
`elsewhere.elements(id)` do the same.

The Broadcasts tab starts and stops independent desktop streams to RTMP/RTMPS services. Presets live
in browser storage and share across instance paths on the same origin. The same controls are available
through HTTP and MCP. See [desktop broadcasts](docs/broadcasts.md), including
[YouTube and Twitch setup](docs/broadcasts.md#youtube-and-twitch-setup).

The viewer lives in `web/` (React, Tailwind CSS, Vite) and is built into `web/dist`, which the binary
embeds at compile time; `make` builds the viewer (Node 24) and then the binary, `make web` only the
viewer, and a `cargo build` without `web/dist` stops with that hint. `npm run dev` in `web/` serves the
page with hot reload, proxying `/ws` and `/api` to a server started with `--no-tls --listen 127.0.0.1:8080`.

Useful flags: `--no-tls` (localhost or HTTPS proxy), `--url-prefix`, `--proxy-strips-prefix`, `--listen`, `--bitrate <kbps>` (Medium ceiling),

machine can't encode stops startup; auto prefers whatever the browser decodes in hardware, among what
this machine encodes: AV1, then HEVC, VP9, H.264 on the GPU; VP8 first on the CPU),

Games and other clients that lock the pointer get raw mouse deltas: the page mirrors the lock with the
Pointer Lock API. In supported application fullscreen, normal Escape reaches the client and holding
Escape releases capture through the browser.

## Source code

Source and build instructions are available in the
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ryanpetris/elsewhere).
For a release, run `elsewhere --version` and check out the matching
`vX.Y.Z` tag. For a development or modified build, use the revision and any local
changes supplied by its distributor; the current default branch may differ.

Install the build dependencies listed under [Install](#install) and
[Requirements](#requirements), then run
`make`. This installs the locked npm dependencies, builds the viewer, and builds
the release binary. `web/package-lock.json` pins viewer dependencies and records
their download URLs and integrity hashes.
